## Project Description

"Track your emotions, improve your wellbeing."

Moodster is a mood-tracking social media platform designed to help users to add, reflect on, and share their emotional states. Users can record their moods with time, emojis, and optional details like triggers, photos, location or social situations. The app also supports social features by allowing users to follow friends, comment on moods, and view shared emotions on a map. It is built with flexibility and offline support, it promotes emotional awareness while building connections.

## Key Features

- [Mood Tracking]: Record your emotional states (happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) with short notes or photos to capture what influenced your mood, and tag social situations—whether you were alone, with a partner etc. As well as have the ability to edit or delete past entries, and choose between private journaling or public sharing to connect with others.
- [Connect with Friends]: Create your profile, discover friends, and stay connected with their emotions. Follow those who matter to you, view their latest moods, share supportive comments, and decide who can follow you back.
- [Mood History & Filters]: Easily track your emotional journey with a personalized mood history. Use filters to sort moods based on emotions, dates, or social situations, helping you gain insights into patterns over time.
- [Geolocation]: Enhance your mood entries with location-based context. Optionally attach your current location to moods, helping you reflect on how different places impact your emotions.
- [Offline Mode]: Stay connected to your emotions even without an internet connection. Add, view, and edit your moods offline, and seamlessly sync your data once you're back online.
- [WOW Factor: User Mentions]: Engage with friends through @mentions in comments. When a user is mentioned (e.g., @username), they can see a count of their mentions and access a chronological list of public moods where they’ve been tagged, making interactions more engaging and meaningful.
